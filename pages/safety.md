The Civil Aviation Authority of New Zealand (CAA) has published [rules](http://www.caa.govt.nz/rpas/index.html) governing the use of RPAS, UAV, UAS, Drones and Model Aircraft.

Pert [part 101](http://www.caa.govt.nz/rules/Part_101_Brief.htm) of the Civil Aviation Rules, I take the following safety precautions:

* Avoid flying at night or over roads
* Equipment is maintained in an "airworthy" state per manufacturer's guidelines
* Equipment will land itself when batteries are too low, rather than "falling out of the sky"
* Manufacturer's pre-flight checklists are carried out prior to each flight
* Unless the project requires otherwise, equipment is "geofenced" to prevent accidental departure from the filming location
