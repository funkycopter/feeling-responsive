The Civil Aviation Authority of New Zealand (CAA) has published [rules](http://www.caa.govt.nz/rpas/index.html) governing the use of RPAS, UAV, UAS, Drones and Model Aircraft.

Since my equipment is under 25kg, my activities fall under [part 101](http://www.caa.govt.nz/rules/Part_101_Brief.htm) of the Civil Aviation Rules, but we do the following to ensure compliance:

* I receive updates from the CAA on updates to rules part 101 or 102, or RPAS
* I document and practice [safety](/safety/) procedures
* I seek [consent](/consent/) from the owners of land I fly over and any people I fly over or film
* I'm transparent and easily [contactable](/contact/) about my filming and activities, and the limitations of the equipment, to avoid any [privacy](/privacy/) concerns
